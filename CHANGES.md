### Updated Task Type Durations
- Deep Work: 90-120 min blocks (previously 90 min)
- Shallow Work: 30-60 min blocks (previously 30 min)
- Break: Explicitly set to 30 min

### Example Output Simplified
```json
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot": 0,
      "duration": 4,
      "task": "ship auth system by 10am",
      "type": "deep",
      "reason": "Scheduled early to ensure completion by 10am deadline"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Overall Impact
- Improved visual consistency
- Better deadline handling
- More flexible task durations
